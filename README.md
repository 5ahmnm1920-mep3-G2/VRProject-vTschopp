# Mystery Physics
Mystery Physics is a virtual reality game developed in [Unity](http://unity.com/) for the
new [Oculus Quest](https://www.oculus.com/quest/). The goal of the game is to solve a puzzle
by manipulating fundamental physical principles like gravity and magnetism.

**This game is only a proof of concept and not yet performant!**

## Roadmap
**Progress:** 5 %

- [x] Develop concept
- [ ] **Test run with the Oculus Quest**
- [ ] Level design
  - [ ] Blockout
  - [ ] 3D models
  - [ ] Textures
  - [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Programming
  - [ ] Basic VR controls
  - [ ] Gravity tools
  - [ ] Magnetism tools
- [ ] Swap placeholder items with final assets
- [ ] Bug fixing

**Bold** indicates the current task worked on.

## Logbook
- **2020-01-15:** Set-up the development environment
  - To develop with the Oculus Quest is just annoying.
    Nothing works out of the box and the official set-up instructions are pure garbage.
    In order to run your game, you have to create an Oculus account, an organisation and an application.
    Furthermore, you have to download the standalone version of the Android SDK.
    Oh and did I mention, that you have to buy an extra USB-cable if you want to connect
    the headset with your PC what doesn't support USB-C yet? :rage:
